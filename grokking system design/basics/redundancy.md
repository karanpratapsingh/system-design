Redundancy
====

- Redundancy: **duplication of critical data or services** with the intention of increased reliability of the system.
- Server failover
  - Remove single points of failure and provide backups (e.g. server failover).
- Shared-nothing architecture
  - Each node can operate independently of one another.
  - No central service managing state or orchestrating activities.
  - New servers can be added without special conditions or knowledge.
  - No single point of failure.
